# About Me
Hi there i am Ganesh 

# whay this 
My inspiration for GSoC 2026 came from wanting to move beyond classroom coding and apply my skills to real-world projects. I wanted to challenge myself by contributing to impactful open-source projects, learning industry-level practices, and working under the guidance of experienced mentors. GSoC gives me that opportunity.
